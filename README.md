# Neighborly  
### *Your Social Life, Memories, and Local Wisdom — All in One App*

Neighborly is what happens when your group chats, calendars, maps, and scattered memories all get together, hold an intervention, and say,  
**“We can’t keep living like this.”**

This project is an attempt to build an app that actually *helps* us maintain friendships, plan things without chaos, discover what’s happening nearby, and remember the good stuff without spending 45 minutes digging through iCloud and Instagram.

It’s not a new social network. It’s not another planner. It’s not a city guide.  
It’s the *brain* your social life has been missing.

# Why Neighborly Exists

Being a human with friends in 2025 is surprisingly exhausting.

- You want to see your friends… but somehow everyone has different schedules, lives across town, and answers WhatsApp messages in geological time.  
- Your photos are hiding across five platforms, which means you only remember your life once a year when Apple randomly drops a slideshow called “Best Friends, Maybe?”  
- Local recommendations are either paid ads, bots, or someone named “townfoodwizard99.”  
- Planning a simple dinner requires more juggling than the average DevOps pipeline.  

Neighborly is here so that *hanging out doesn’t feel like project management*, and staying connected doesn’t require a spreadsheet.

# What Neighborly Actually Does (In Human Terms)

### **It remembers your memories for you.**  
Monthly highlight reels, friendship timelines, and “You haven’t seen Jamie in 102 days, maybe fix that?” style nudges.  
Kind of like a scrapbook that texts you.

### **It plans things without the logistical meltdown.**  
Pick a date, pick some people, and Neighborly figures out:  
- where you should meet,  
- how everyone gets there,  
- the travel time,  
- the WhatsApp reminders,  
- and the “are you almost here?” live location dance.

It even checks what’s trending locally so you don’t accidentally book dinner at a place currently melting down on X.

### **It syncs your friend groups with your lists.**  
All those shared Google lists—restaurants to try, bucket lists, packing lists—they actually *do something* now.  
Neighborly turns them into real plans, suggestions, or “Hey, you saved this place four months ago… want to actually go?”

### **It gives you local wisdom without the internet nonsense.**  
Ask your network things like:  
- “Electrician recommendations?”  
- “Where’s good for remote work near East Sixth?”  
- “What was that loud boom just now?”  

Answers come from people you trust: friends, friends-of-friends, or verified locals—not bots or review farms.

### **It helps you discover gentle social serendipity.**  
Weekly, it shows:  
- events you and your friends might like,  
- micro-hangouts you can plan in 10 seconds,  
- interesting neighborhood happenings,  
- and places your friends keep saving but never go to.

# The Neighborly Loop

Here’s the magic:

1. You make memories  
2. Neighborly surfaces those memories  
3. Memories inspire ideas  
4. Ideas become plans  
5. Plans become more memories  

And just like that, your social life becomes self-sustaining instead of “Oops, it’s been six months.”

# The Big Idea

Your favorite apps are great individually—Instagram for memories, Google Maps for places, WhatsApp for friends, Google Shared Lists for planning, X for local updates…  
But none of them talk to each other.

**Neighborly is the glue.**  
It’s the part that helps your real life feel just a little more connected, cozy, and effortless.

It’s your social intuition, but with superpowers.

# Current Status

This repository is just the beginning.  
There’s a ton to explore, prototype, and test.  
Think of it as the sketchbook for a future app that wants to make being social delightful again.

Contributions, ideas, and random epiphanies are welcome.  
Open an issue, start a thread, or yell into the void politely.

# Say Hi

If you want to help build this, riff on ideas, or convince me that Neighborly should absolutely include a “friendship horoscope,” feel free to reach out.

Let’s make real-life connection easier.
